## Methods
The methods used to calculate the Gulf Stream Index changed between 2019 and 2020 SOEs. The most recent methods and at the top with older methods below those.

This gulf stream index is a position anomaly meaning the larger the value of the index the further north the northern wall of the Gulf Stream is for that year. 

### Data sources
Data used in this analysis come from Compernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service [CMEMS - GLOBAL OCEAN GRIDDED L4 SEA SURFACE HEIGHTS AND DERIVED VARIABLES REPROCESSED (1993-ONGOING)](https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00148)(Product ID: SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047).

### Data analysis

The GSI is originally calculated by @perez-hernandez2014, which is a simple 16-point GS index constructed by selecting grid points following the maximum Standard deviation of sea level height anomalies every 1.33° longitude between 52° and 72°W and averaging them. The value of 1.33° is based on the resolution of satellite dataset from AVISO.  

We followed the same method, except using the dataset from [CMEMS](https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00148), which now has a 0.125°x0.125° resolution available from Jan. 1993 to Dec. 2023. We calculated the standard deviation (STD) of SSH over the time period of 1993-2018, and select points every 1° between 52° and 72°W along the latitudinal maximum STD. Later, monthly SSH of these 21 points are averaged and standarized to obtain the time series from Jan. 1993 to Dec. 2023.

### Data Processing

The Gulf Stream index data set was formatted for inclusion in the `ecodata` R package with the code found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_gsi.R). The computation code can be found [here](https://github.com/zchenocean/Gulf-Stream-Indices/blob/main/GSI_SSH-based_using_satellite_cmems_ssh_0.125deg.ipynb).

### Data Sources

Sea Surface Height data is available at [Compernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service](https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00148)(Product ID: SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047).

### Data processing and plotting

Data processing and plotting remained the same between years.
